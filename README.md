<h3>1.-Introduction</h3>
I've been always interested in game modding and how people can modify them  in spite of not having the source code, so I wanted to have a first view of how they do it.

for this case we will need two things: 
<ol>
  <li>the target (which we will code in order to not having legal issues)</li>
  <li>the inyector, that will modify the target</li>
<ol>
<h3>2.-Finding the instruction we want to modify</h3>
<h3>3.-Making target jump to other address</h3>
